# Game Collection
A collection of games that I plan to add to over time.
Currently there are only three very rudimentary games: Rock, Paper, Scissors, a random number guesser, and pig dice.
It also functions over the terminal.

## Planned Features
- A UI powered by PyQt6
- More games
- A pronoun dressing room

### Known bugs
- None yet. Program is too small.
